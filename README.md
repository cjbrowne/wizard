# Wizard
Wizard is a parser for the WizL "zen" programming language.

# WizL
Why say in ten words what you can say in two?
WizL aims to provide a language-agnostic command structure for a 
(currently) hypothetical IDE with the speed and flexibility of Vim but
the code-generation and static-analysis features one has come to expect
from modern IDEs.

# WIDE
Is the IDE based on Wizard/WizL.  Work will begin in earnest once the
parser has reached an appropriate level of maturity.

## Influences
This project was in part influenced by the zen-coding HTML/CSS language
and in part by an article describing the Ithkuil natural language.
